During my time at Microsoft I have worked pretty extensively with both [Azure Dev Ops](https://dev.azure.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/), and I have praise and qualms for both. I break down my opinions into important sections these services should provide.

#### Current Favorite

**ADO** - ADO wins out on the superior productivity features. However, for an open source project, especially one that wants to accept community contributions, GitHub is far superior.

#### Creating a repo

Winner: Tie

| | GitHub | ADO | Notes |
| | -- | -- | -- |
| Easily create a repo tied to your account | ✔️ | 🤔 | GitHub this is one button click. With ADO you have to first create an "organization" then a "project". |
| Easily create a repo tied to your organization | ✔️  | ✔️ | Both can tie repos to an org and set policies. ADO is more feature rich in this area. |

With both you can perform this task with relative ease. For a single user GitHub is far simpler and a nicer process. For an organization ADO wins this.
