# How we created an npm package from sub packages

## Problem

We decided to create a [monorepo](https://monorepo.tools/) for our frontend library code. Within our monorepo, we created seperate packages for logical splits in our [codebase](https://github.com/Azure/communication-ui-library); components, composites, stateful-clients, common code. However, when release time came around we wanted to be able to publish a single package to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) that exported all functionality from our monorepo.

## Solution

A **metapackage**. A package that imports then re-exports functionality from the other packages (from now on I will refer to these sub-packages as **packlets**). While this sounds simple, we ran into a number of friction points.

### Issue: Combining exports from multiple packages

Our build system is non-trivial with a number of build artifacts. We build packlets in a dependency tree order (using [Rush](https://rushjs.io/)) with each packlet generating a CommonJS bundle, an ESM bundle, and an API file. Our task was to ensure the metapackage could produce an output that combined these outputs.

#### 1.1 How to combine packlets

To create the metapackage we do not leverage the build outputs from each individual build but instead have a lone _index.ts_ file that imports and re-exports the exports from each packlet. This means all files are transpiled and bundled twice; once when the packlet is built, and once when the metapackage is built.

```tsx
/// metapackage index.ts

export * from "../packlet1";
export * from "../packlet2";
export * from "../packlet3";
```

This allowed us to create build artifacts that only contained the exports from the packlets we wanted to export, were treeshaken correctly, and had a single rolled-up API file based on those exports. [Here is our active metapackage index.ts file](https://github.com/Azure/communication-ui-library/blob/main/packages/communication-react/src/index.ts).

#### 1.2 Handling conflicting exports

We ran into an issue where two packlets exported the same thing. For example, two packlets exported a _usePropsFor_ utility function. This meant that when we re-exported the _usePropsFor_ component from the metapackage we would get a conflict. To solve this we had to rename the exports from the packlets. This was a simple change to the packlet's index.ts file.

```tsx
/// packlet1 index.ts
export { usePropsFor as useCallingPropsFor } from "./hooks/usePropsFor";

/// packlet2 index.ts
export { usePropsFor as useChatPropsFor } from "./hooks/usePropsFor";
```

We ended up [merging these functions into a single API function](https://github.com/Azure/communication-ui-library/blob/0020b07e979b896b72ba4d0ac231f4cc9793ff8f/packages/communication-react/src/mergedHooks.ts#L118) for the metapackage for ease of use, but this was not necessary.

#### 1.3 Handling incorrect downstream imports

Now each package was being bundled and we were generating a correct API file. But one problem existed: the ESM bundle has imports that pointed to internal packlets. For example, the _Call Composite_ composite in the metapackage would import _StartCallButton_ from the component package. This meant that when the metapackage was installed and used, the ESM bundle would fail to resolve the import.

```tsx
/// metapackage CallComposite/StartCallScreen.tsx
import { StartCallButton } from "@internal/react-components"; // <-- this import will not resolve correctly in the metapackage ESM bundle
```

To handle this, we had to rewrite the imports at transpile or bundle time. To do this, we choose to use [_ttypscript_](https://github.com/cevek/ttypescript), a tool that can apply transformations to the code at transpile time, and a plugin [ts-tranform-paths](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zerollup/ts-transform-paths) that can rewrite imports.

```tsx
// metapackage tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@internal/chat-component-bindings": ["../../chat-component-bindings/src"],
      "@internal/calling-component-bindings": ["../../calling-component-bindings/src"],
      "@internal/acs-ui-common": ["../../acs-ui-common/src"],
      "@internal/calling-stateful-client": ["../../calling-stateful-client/src"],
      "@internal/chat-stateful-client": ["../../chat-stateful-client/src"],
      "@internal/react-components": ["../../react-components/src"],
      "@internal/react-composites": ["../../react-composites/src"]
    },
    "plugins": [
      {
        "transform": "@zerollup/ts-transform-paths"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This transformed the import line to instead have a relative path to the correct file in the dist directory:

```tsx
// Before
import { StartCallButton } from "@internal/react-components";

// After
import { StartCallButton } from '../react-components';
```

## FAQs

### Why not release multiple packages?

- Confusing imports - _Which package contains what I need?_
- Maintenance - _Maintaing releases of 7+ packages_
- Ensuring consistency - _Users may use different versions of each package_

### Any Downsides?

- Dependencies - _If a user only wants functionality from one packlet, they will still have to install all dependencies_
