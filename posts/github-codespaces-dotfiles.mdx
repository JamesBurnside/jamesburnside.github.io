# Make GitHub Codespaces automatically pick up a custom gitconfig

Have you ever created a new codespace and found it frustrating that your git aliases no longer work?
I have, and turns out it is incredibly easy to get codespaces to pick up a custom gitconfig automatically! (Just undocumented on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/personalizing-github-codespaces-for-your-account#dotfiles) ðŸ¤·)

## GitHub Codespaces and dotfiles

GitHub codespaces supports setting up [dotfiles](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/personalizing-github-codespaces-for-your-account).
Dotfiles are scripts and configs that are automatically copied into your codespace when it is created. This is a great way to set up your environment to your liking.

To set this up, first create a repo to house your dotfiles (example: [JamesBurnside/dotfiles](JamesBurnside/dotfiles)).
Then, to point GitHub to pull these when it creates new codespaces, set this repo as your dotfiles repo under [settings > codespaces](https://github.com/settings/codespaces):

As of writing this _does not update existing codespaces_, it only applies to newly created codespaces.

## Adding gitconfig to your dotfiles

There is nothing special about gitconfig, it is just a file that is read by git when it is run.
All you need to do is add a file called `.gitconfig` to your dotfiles repo, and it will be copied into your codespaces when they are created!

See [JamesBurnside/dotfiles](JamesBurnside/dotfiles) for an example of how my dotfiles repo is set up.
